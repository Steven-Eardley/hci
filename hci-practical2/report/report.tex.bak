\section{Cooperative Evaluation}
We had two subjects use both the software we were evaluating and our software from part one.  We gave them a set of tasks (Appendix~\ref{sec:tasks}) designed test all the functionality of both systems.  We then timed them performing the tasks, made observations on how they were interacting with the systems and then had the complete a survey for both pieces of software to gauge their reactions.

We chose this set of tasks as it covered all the visible functionality of the software we were investigating as well as covering our software (apart from launching the help guide).  And the tasks seemed to us like a reasonable approximation of a user using the software.

Both subjects were non-informatics naive users, and we tried to let them work out what to do without prompting, although we did prompt if they became very stuck.

Software 1 is the software given to us to evaluate and software 2 is our software we developed in part one.

\subsection{Subject A}

\subsubsection{Software 1}
It took the subject 8 minutes and 51 seconds to complete the set of tasks. 

Our observations noticed that throughout the tasks the user was asking questions on what to do and how to do it, they had to refer to the help guide multiple times, including for the same task: how to go into edit mode.  The subjet also started to display frustration, at one point swearing at the computer.  They attempted to apply external knowledge in the form of keyboard shortcuts.  They were also appeared frustrated when pressing buttons that had no feedback indicating success or failure.  When the subject was required to move the shape to a new lamppost they tried to move the whole shape in one, not move it point by point.

The survey (Appendix~\ref{sec:survey}, Table~\ref{tab:a1}) taken at the end indicates in general that they thought the software was good, the only area that really needs improvement would be the appearance.

\subsubsection{Software 2}
It took the subject 5 minutes and 20 seconds to complete the set of tasks.

Our observations noticed that the icons on the button seemed to help the user work out what to do, and the textual tooltips shown when the mouse was hovered over a button aided the user to confirm the use until the function was remembered.  The subject coped fairly well with this software until it came to editing and deleting.  We had to explain to the subject that to move a marking it had to be deleted and redrawn.  Attempting to edit again induced a rage with the subject swearing at the computer.  The user had to be prompted to click in the label box on the right hand side to select object ready to be marked or deleted.  They did only need to be prompted on this the first time. The subject did not find the right-click shortcut to undo drawing, which caused some confusion throughout the tasks.

The survey (Appendix~\ref{sec:survey}, Table~\ref{tab:a2}) taken at the end indicates that in general they thought the software was good.  There is only one area that needs improvment and that is deleting a marked object.  It is interesting that they gave deleting and editing different scores as they require the same procedure.

\subsection{Subject B}
\subsubsection{Software 1}
It took the subject 8 minutes and 29 seconds to complete the set of tasks.

Our observations noticed that straight away the subject struggled with opening an image, this software displayed all files, not just image files which confused the subject.  Also when the subject needed to use the help guide it was described as "too wordy".  The subject also struggled with moving the markings, attempting to move without being in the correct mode.  Switching modes had to be prompted to them, and they had to be prompted every time the mode needed to be switched.

The survey (Appendix~\ref{sec:survey}, Table~\ref{tab:b1}) taken at the end indicates mixed feelings about this software.  The core functionality of marking objects is marked as not easy, and the subject did not like the appearence of the software and overall had a negative experience.


\subsubsection{Software 2}
It took the subject 6 minutes and 56 seconds to complete the set of tasks.

Our observations noticed that again using the listbox needed to be more prominent as we had to prompt the subject to use that to allow editing and deleting.  Again we had to explain that moving required deleting and redrawing.  The subject did discover one of our keyboard shortcuts: ctrl-z for undo.  They then proceeded to use this throughout the task.

The survey (Appendix~\ref{sec:survey}, Table~\ref{tab:b2}) taken at the end indicates the subject had a more positive experience than with the first piece of software: there were no negative marks.  Overall the subject indicating a strong positive experience.  Interestingly there is a big difference in how easy this subject found deleting objects than subject A, this could be because editing is covered first and the two procedures are similar so when deleting was required they already knew the prerequisites for this.

\subsection{Findings}
Both subjects said both pieces of software made them feel stupid, despite the high ratings they awarded.  Which inidicates that both pieces of software failed at being user friendly.

One potential issue with our experiment is that by having the users use two pieces of software is that when they use the second piece of software they are not necessarily naive users, they may have learned from the first software.  This could be the cause of the shorted times both users had on software two.  One way we could have mitigated this is by having each user use the software in a different order, unfortunately we did not do this.

Both subjects rated software 2's appearence as better than software 1's.  This is probably due to the icons on the buttons in software 2, and that unlike software 1 these buttons are equally sized and spaced.

One of the subjects was dyslexic and colour blind and was dissapointed that neither software had any provision for either of these.  This may have had a performance on the subject's performance on the tasks.

For software 1 anything relating to editing caused a lot of problems for the user, this we believe is due to the unintuitive 'toggle mode' feature.  For software 2 it was deleting and loading data that were identified as causing problems.

A more detailed analysis of the areas for improvements in software 2, including survey results and observations, shows that: the documentation, toggling of modes, provide feedback from interactions, moving the shape as a whole not point by point, filtering of files and a general improvement in aesthetic are the todo points for the software.

Whilst we cannot be 100\% sure, due to the way the experiment was run, it was in software 2 that the tasks were completed faster.  Our observations of the subjects noticed less problems with software 2 than software 1.  The survey results themselves also indicate a slight preference for software 2 with both users having a more positive experience with software 2. However, as both pieces of software made them feel stupid we know that both need serious improvement.

\section{Evaluation and Comparison}

The software we were given to evaluate does not adhere particularly well to Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules (Appendix~\ref{sec:s_rules}), with breaches of rules 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8. 

Rule 1 is breached by the operations requiring numerous switches of focus between the image window and the button panel. For example, to edit a complete polygon the user is required to click the 'Toggle mode' button, select a polygon in the image, click the 'Start editing' button, manipulate the polyon points within the image, and finally click the 'Stop editing' button. This sequence of actions is significantly longer and different to each of the other avaiable in the program. In comparison, software 2 allow the user to complete a shape by clicking the first point again, keeping the focus on the image region.

For Rule 3, feedback is a problem because when the mode has been changed via the 'Toggle mode' button there is no indication of what each mode is for. The user is expected to know which mode they are in by the options available - the 'greying out' of the 'Finish current label' button is helpful but does not redeem this enough. Software 2 has greater feedback when drawing shapes: when a shape is completed the area is shaded, and polygons placed on top of each other appear different shades so can be identified, rather than just the outline being visible.

The breach of Rule 4 occurs when we first open the application; the user is immediately confronted by a standard open file dialogue, but no indication that the tagger itself is running. This can be a little disconcerting. Additionally, whenever the load tags button is clicked the user is prompted that current changes will be lost, even if there aren't any unsaved changes in the space, or indeed any polygons at all. This needlessly interrupts user flow. Our system was deliberately designed to only show dialogues when required: when there are unsaved changes, or when a user action requires reassurance that the operation has been carried out. 

The program also doesn't include an 'undo' functionality, so breaks Rule 6. Because of this, to cancel a point drawn in error, an entire polygon must be created, labelled and deleted. Rule 8 is not met because changing mode adds needless cognitive load: remembering which mode the program is in, and the sequence of actions to change it. As discussed above, it was found to cause test subjects some difficulty.

The evaluation program does conform well with rule 2: shortcuts exist in the standard menu fashion, i.e. pressing the 'Alt' key with the underlined letter performs that button click. This is an effective way of speeding up the process, and something we ensured we included in the software we presented.

The remaining rules, 5 and 7, are maintained in incidentally by the application: the task is such that there is little scope for serious error, and the user has full control of the program with no time-sensitive operations.

To improve compliance with Shneiderman's Golden Rules, reducing the steps to edit a finished polygon would be required; perhaps clicking and dragging a vertex when in the editing mode should initiate the action, removing the need for a specific (and currently misleadingly labelled) button. The 'Toggle Mode' button could be renamed to show the current mode, e.g. 'Switch to edit mode' when drawing and 'Return to draw mode' when editing. This would improve feedback and reduce cognitive load. To improve adherence with Rule 4, it would be helpful for the labelling interface to open first, with the open image dialogue appearing by clicking prompt in the centre of the image region. This would give the user an indication of what the program expects (an image path), and why they are doing it (there is no image to tag). An undo function could be added to comply with rule 6, with a key shortcut and a button below 'Finish current label'.

Through an exploration (Appendix~\ref{sec:task_breakdown}) of best-case sequences of actions required to complete each of our tasks, we find that the evaluation software is more difficult to use when compared to the system we presented for part 1. Common repetitive actions such as sequentially labelling a selection of shapes require more time and cognitive load, since attention has to be transferred between the image region and the controls on the right hand side. In our software the flow is uninterrupted as a user can complete a shape, type a label and continue drawing polygons without changing their focus.

In total we find that the user is required to make at least 41 actions, 69 without key shortcuts, to complete the tasks using software 1, compared to 38 and 57 with software 2. Of note is the use of informative dialogues our system, software 2, which improve feedback while the system still remains below software 1's operation count. However, there are tasks in which software 1 is easier to use than software 2; to move a label to a different region in the image in software 1 the functionality exists to move the points, whereas in software 2 the user is required to delete and redraw the label. This results in significantly more operations when the redrawing is taken into account. Software 2 also struggled where users did not learn the methods for achieving actions such as undo (a right-click), while software 1 provided available controls visually on the interface as buttons.

\section{Interface Improvements}
Through practical and theoretical analysis of the software we have identified the following areas to be addressed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Click on original node to finish marking}
    \item{Show the main program along with file chooser on startup}
    \item{Stop prompting saying unsaved changes when there were no changes}
    \item{Add undo functionality}
    \item{Rename toggle mode button to edit mode}
    \item{Reorder the edit process so you click the button then the shape}
    \item{Simplify the documentation}
    \item{Give user feedback even when the action does nothing}
    \item{Move shapes as a whole not point by point}
    \item{Filter by filetypes}
    \item{Make prettier in general}
    \item{Make it more accessible}
\end{enumerate}

Items 1, 6, 4 and 9 became apparant in the user testing, they were the actions that the users tried to perform with no knowledge of the system, so by implementing them new users should be able to use the system more effectively.  Items 2, 3, 5, 8 and 10 were sections that led to the users being confused, so by fixing these issues the users will be able to more effectively use the software.  Item 7 will make it easier for a user to work out what to do if something goes wrong, it will also make it easier for somebody with reading difficulties to fix problems, which is item 12.  For item 11 a simple way to solve this is to not use the default swing theme, an issue relating to this that neither user mentioned is that the label text is drawn onto the image in a bright green colour, making it near impossible to read.  Either the colour should be changed, or the labels should have an appropriate flat background colour, this would make it possible to read the labels.

Below we decompose the user tasks into the direct sequence of operations required in each program. As before, software 1 is the software given to us to evaluate and software 2 is our software we developed in part one.
